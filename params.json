You will need this to control the GPIO pins on the RPi and a switch to signal the main script to do it's work.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to install usbutils - Linux USB utilities - to obtain lsusb.  lsusb  is  a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them. I found lsusb more useful for detecting when a camera was attached to the RPi and turned on.  I could have used gphoto2 with the autodetect switch but I found lsusb was faster.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to compile usbreset.  This handy piece of code helped reset the USB interface to the Nikon camera in between brackets sets.  I found that without usbreset that gphoto2 would generate a lot of errors using the Nikon.\r\n\r\nYou will need to install Perl to run the HDR scripts.  This might already be a part of your library.\r\n\r\n*USE*\r\n\r\nOnce everything is installed, you need to tweak the script a bit to get it to work with different cameras. For example, I used lsusb to specific USB ID for my Nikon D40.  I used that in the script.  You will also need to determine the proper gphotos2 parameters for you camera.  Once you have the camera specific parameters and functions in place, you can use the Perl scripts to begin taking images.\r\n\r\nperl hdr.pl\r\n\r\nThere is also an rc script which you can use to start the HDR script automatically whenever the computer (raspberry pi) is turned on.  To setup this feature run the following commands:\r\n\r\nsudo ln ./rc.hdr /etc/init.d/rc.hdr\r\ncd /etc/init.d/\r\nsudo update-rc.d rc.hdr defaults\r\n\r\n*ADDITIONAL INFORMATION & AUTHOR*\r\n\r\nhttp://islandinthenet.com/2013/02/18/hdr-photography-with-a-raspberry-pi/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
